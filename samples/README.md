# Fingerprinting Samples

## About

Within this directory, you will find some sample fingerprints that will help you to fool NMAP scans into thinking the emulated services are the versions you choose. 

## Adding Fingerprints

All fingerprints within this directory have been tested and confirmed to work, but you are welcome to add more. The key to a working fingerprint is generating a string that matches an NMAP fingerprinting attempt. You can find NMAP's service fingerprinting strings [HERE](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nmap-service-probes).

If you add some strings of your own, and you can confirm they work, please let me know, and I will have them added here.
